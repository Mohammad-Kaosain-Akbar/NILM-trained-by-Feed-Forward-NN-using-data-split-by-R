The Feed Forward Neural Network based NILM model was trained using training and testing dataset which was generated during NILM model generated using Dirichlet Regression
through usage of R programming language.

80% of the dataset for training
20% of the dataset is for testing

Here, X-variables were not normalized. 

The code used for splitting the original Dataset can be found in the link below:
